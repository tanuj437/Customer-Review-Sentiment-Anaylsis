## üéØ Goal
The goal of this sentiment analysis project is to enhance understanding of customer perceptions by organizing and analyzing reviews. By automatically classifying these reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, the project aims to provide insights into public opinion trends.

## üßÆ What I Did
In this sentiment analysis project, various models were evaluated to find the most effective one for classifying customer reviews. The models evaluated include:

### Logistic Regression

A simple linear model for binary and multi-class classification.
Achieved a high accuracy and balanced precision-recall performance.
### LightGBM Classifier

A Light Gradient Boosting Machine known for its efficiency and performance with large datasets.
Achieved competitive accuracy and was used as one of the benchmark models.
### XGBoost Classifier

An implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.
Achieved competitive accuracy and served as another benchmark model.
### AdaBoost Classifier

An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
Achieved good performance, particularly in precision and recall.

### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

**Data Cleaning:** Normalized text, removed missing values, and duplicates.

**Tokenization:** Processed text data to remove stop words and perform lemmatization.

**TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
